/// @dev Two instances are deployed: one for vbUSDC (REF, isRefVault=true) and one for cST (isRefVault=false).

/// @dev WITHDRAWAL PROTECTION (_withdraw override):
///      Replaces the external hook approach (ERC4626EVCCollateral does not expose setHookConfig).
///      Invariants enforced inline on every withdraw/redeem.

///      NOTE: transfer()/transferFrom() on vault shares bypass these overrides (OZ ERC20 goes
///      through _update, not _withdraw). The EVC account status check (health factor via oracle)
///      is the protection for that path. If a transfer reduces cST below the 1:1 pairing, the
///      oracle prices less REF, collateral value drops, and the EVC reverts if the position
///      becomes unhealthy. For accounts with sufficient margin, a cosmetic pairing break is
///      possible but economically handled by the oracle.
///
///      cST vault (isRefVault=false):
///        If the owner has any sUSDe debt -> revert. cST cannot be removed while borrowing.
///

///        If the owner has sUSDe debt -> require pairedVault (cST vault) balance > 0.

///        If pairedVault is not yet configured (address(0)), the check is skipped.
