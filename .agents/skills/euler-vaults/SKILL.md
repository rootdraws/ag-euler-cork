# Euler Finance Agent Skill

Core guide for interacting with Euler Finance V2 protocol. Contains rules across 5 categories covering vault operations, EVC orchestration, risk management, architecture concepts, and security.

## Companion Skills

For specialized topics, use these companion skills:
- **euler-irm-oracles** - Oracle adapters, EulerRouter, price resolution, Interest Rate Models
- **euler-earn** - EulerEarn yield aggregation, strategies
- **euler-advanced** - Hooks, flash loans, fee flow, rewards
- **euler-data** - Lens contracts, subgraphs, contract interfaces, developer tools

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Depositing, borrowing, or managing positions on Euler vaults (EVK)
- Batching operations via the Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC)
- Monitoring health factors and liquidation risk
- Understanding Euler architecture (vault types, market design)
- Security practices and audit information

## Rule Categories by Priority

| # | Category | Impact | Prefix | Key Questions |
|---|----------|--------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Vault Operations | CRITICAL | `vault-` | Get APY, deposit, borrow, create market |
| 2 | EVC Operations | CRITICAL | `evc-` | Batch calls, sub-accounts, operators |
| 3 | Risk Management | HIGH | `risk-` | Check health, liquidation, risk managers, curators |
| 4 | Architecture | HIGH | `arch-` | Market design, vault types |
| 5 | Security | CRITICAL | `sec-` | Audits, best practices |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Vault Operations (CRITICAL)

- `vault-get-apy` - How to get vault APY and interest rates
- `vault-deposit` - How to deposit assets into a vault
- `vault-borrow` - How to borrow assets from a vault
- `vault-repay` - How to repay borrowed debt
- `vault-create-market` - How to create a new vault/market

### 2. EVC Operations (CRITICAL)

- `evc-batch` - How to batch multiple operations atomically
- `evc-sub-accounts` - How to use sub-accounts for isolated positions
- `evc-operators` - How to delegate control via operators
- `evc-enable-collateral` - How to enable vault as collateral

### 3. Risk Management (HIGH)

- `risk-check-health` - How to check account health factor
- `risk-liquidation` - How liquidations work on Euler
- `risk-managers` - Understanding risk manager roles

### 4. Architecture (HIGH)

- `arch-market-design` - Understanding Euler market design
- `arch-vault-types` - Core, Edge, and Escrow vault types

### 5. Security (CRITICAL)

- `sec-audits` - Security practices and audit information

## Core Protocol Components

### Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC)
The EVC is the foundational layer mediating between vaults. It provides:
- **Batching**: Execute multiple operations atomically
- **Sub-accounts**: 256 isolated positions per address
- **Operators**: Delegate control over your accounts to other addresses
- **Deferred checks**: Temporarily violate constraints within a batch

### Euler Vault Kit (EVK)
Credit vaults extending ERC-4626 with borrowing:
- Standard ERC-4626 deposit/withdraw/mint/redeem
- Borrow and repay functionality
- Collateral and controller management
- LTV ratios (borrow LTV vs liquidation LTV)

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/vault-get-apy.md
rules/evc-batch.md
rules/risk-check-health.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references
